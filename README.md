# express-static-boilerplate

This is a `express.js` boilerplate. Designed to serve static content from the `public` directory. Feel free add your own stuffðŸ˜€ .

How to get started:

1. Clone it
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start` OR start the server with a long-running daemon like `supervisor` or `nodemon`

You can send `email` and `name` to the mock api endpoint `/api/subscribe` to check the response.

*You set up your own middleware as you needed. Please mind any vulnerability.*

Happy Coding ðŸ˜œ
